# 🚘 Travel Trucks Service - Camper Rental App

## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create the frontend part of a web application for the company **"TravelTrucks"**, which provides camper van rentals. The application consists of several pages:

- **Home Page**
- **Catalog Page** with filtering options
- **Camper Details Page** with gallery, reviews, and booking form

Users can explore available campers, filter results based on specific parameters, view camper details, read reviews, and submit a booking request.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-trucks-service.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 📅 Note for Vercel deployment:

For smooth deployment on Vercel and to handle peer dependency issues, the custom install command is configured directly in the Vercel project settings:

**Navigate to:**  
`Project Settings → Build & Development Settings → Framework Settings → Install Command`

**Enable the override** and set the following command:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This ensures the project builds successfully despite any peer dependency conflicts.
The command was added specifically to support React Simple Image Viewer, since this library is not fully compatible with React 19.
